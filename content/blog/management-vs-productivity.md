No one believes that a manager is productive, not even the manager himself. Why is so? I’ve been managing people for a last few years and when you have been an individual contributor your whole life this seems like important but unproductive work. I’ll explain myself in detail in next few minutes but let’s take a moment to evaluate this feeling that we get.

The role of a manager is very different from that of an individual contributor and we need to get in terms with that idea first before we can be good at our job. So what are really the responsibilities of a manager?

## 1. Get Work Done

You are an enabler. 99% of the time your job is to mentor, guide and enable other folks on your team to do the job which you are already competent in. You could do the same task in 30 minutes which is going to take probably one day for a memeber on your team and that is fine. This does not mean you jump in and help them. This was the earliest lesson anyone in this role would learn. 

You may need to get your hands dirty 1% of the time in case of emergency but if possible avoid that.

## 2. How you get the work done?

As a manager there are so many ways to get the work done. You could give out step by step algorithm which the other person just needs to execute. There will be days and tasks when this will be needed but most often then not your goal is to build the thought process. If you can get people to see the problems and appoach them in a way that you do, that's a win. Some individuals may be naturally talented and some may be less. You have to vary your engagement with each one basis of what they need.

## 3. Ensuring accuracy and productivity

You need to ensure that everyone on the team is productive by doing things like estimations and commitments. You become the gatekeeper to disallow your team from over commiting or under commiting. You need to be fair to both the sides as the bridge. You work as a sponge - sometimes absorbing more pressure and some time realying more.
