Life is interestingly chaotic. We die for that which we don't have and then get bored of that same thing when we get it. I sometimes feel that what we want is a pursuit of something. The struggle and hard work make us feel whole. In the journey, we forget everything and focus on achieving that goal. 

This brings me to thinking - what do I want from life now? I have a loving family, a beautiful wife, a house to live in, a car that drives well, and now a child that won't let me sleep(or let my wife sleep).

After thinking for a few minutes about these questions, which have been in my head for years, I can write down a few things.

1. I want a house with a green cover and where I wake up with the sun's light on my face. Yes, you can imagine that dream vacation wakeup scene we all know, but that's what I want every day. üè°
1. I want a car that's even better to drive. Yes, I'm talking about those cars that drive fucking nice but have nil legroom for my parents at the back. üöò
1. I want maybe an even prettier wife. If you don't see my next blog, please reach out for my well-being, as my wife also reads this. ü§û
1. I want to invest so I don't have to work and have financial freedom to enjoy the above 3. Lol. üòÇ

If you see, I have everything a man could ask for in life, but then if I don't have a new goal for more, what will be the coal I put in my engine?

I do have a bigger purpose for myself; I want to create an impact on humankind. Not a genius like Mr. Musk üõ∏ but still something. But maybe I don't fully believe in that purpose yet, and that's not fuel enough to move this steam engine.

Then I ask myself today: Do you need all of these things? Or do you want to experience these and then move over? The latter. 

I tried to buy a new car and house, and every time I make a move, I see very little economic sense in doing that. Worrying about debt, purchasing something that depreciates, the uncertainty of how much I will use it and when I will get bored of this too - I'm always trying to decide. And I've read somewhere that if the answer is not a clear yes, it's a clear no!

And this is when I must declare I've not tried or taken any effort or interest to further my expressed desire in point no. 3. No lady will be able to put up with me as this one does. ‚ù§Ô∏è And I always think of her, even as I write.

These are the questions I'm asking myself on the brink of being 30. Keep following me to discover how I blow all my earnings in the next chapter of my life. :)
