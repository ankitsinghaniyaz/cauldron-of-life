Life is imperfect, and things usually don't turn out how we want, and the same seems to have happened with me and my dog. They say that every dog has a different personality, but there are days when I feel I have been shortchanged for a bad apple. 😅

You may ask what's wrong with my dog, but that's for later. My dog is almost 3 years, and you may be asking why I am bringing this up. What does it have to do with life? I would say - a lot.

> P.S. He's also worried that his owner is not what he imagined either, so it may go both ways!

You see, we are sold dreams - a dream of a home, a spouse, a vacation, a retirement, a perfect dog, and many more. 

Though it turns out we have been sold a eutopia which is not entirely true. They didn't lie to us, but they hid the fact that there's another side to the coin. The perfect cloudy weather on a hill station is brilliant, but it also causes downpours. You do get the ideal life partner that makes your life wonderful, but it also involves constant nurturing and care, and there are lows. Yes, a dream home is a fantastic place to rejoice in, but it has a cost to upkeep, maintain, and anchor you down.

> There are nights when the moon is bright, and therefore there will be nights that will be darker!

I was told that a dog is loyal, friendly, and protects you and your family. He would be eager to listen to you and would love to cuddle and spend time with you. All of my dreams came out to be naught with my second dog. I'm not crying as if I'm heartbroken after my first love, but you know how it feels when your expectations are not met...

Even so, I take it as a learning opportunity and give the guy his freedom. He's not bound to love, care for, or protect me. Just don't bite me if you can, please? I will understand or try to do so that you are a unique being with life and have your ways. I am quirky in ways that you may be upset with me. Maybe I don't spend the time with you that you deserve. And probably, I don't love you as much as you would have liked. I needed to be more prompt to train and help you socialize as you grew. But alas, we are both on the losing end now.

The reality is what you have is what is real! Anything more and anything less is fiction. You may want things to be and some things to not be, but life doesn't give a damn about what you want. It happens, and if you can manage it and live with it, you will be happy. If you can't, you will be your own constant source of suffering, blaming things and people who may barely be a cause.

The goal is to learn to accept things and not let our hungry minds ruin stuff with its desire for more. Man's hunger for more is a great driving force, and that's what keeps us moving and evolving, but that's also our curse.

Life is what it is. Life will be what it has to be. You don't have to worry much about it. Just accept and smile. :)
