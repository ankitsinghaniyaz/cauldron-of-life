India is one of the emerging economies, and it is a unique country when it comes to politics. It has always taken a neutral, independent and self-conscious stand in international matters.
Why is it so? Why does India need to be neutral and not take sides most of the time? And why do I say that China is attempting to checkmate India?

## 1. Lack of Hard Power 

Thank god we have nuclear to our aid, which we may never have to use, but it helps us deter our adversaries - China and Pakistan. After the Ukraine crisis and other fights worldwide, we see countries with hard power flex it. India does not have such hard power. We are building our ~~defence~~ offensive capabilities, and it could take a few decades for us to become an absolute power.

The first thing we need is to have our military capabilities self-sufficient. We are highly dependent on other nations for our defence equipment and technologies that hold us back in making the right decisions on the global front.

We depend on Russia, France, Isreal and USA for our military supplies. Russia's share is almost 70%.


## 2. Net Energy Importer

Energy is the economy's currency in the 21st century, and oil is still the $$$ king. India doesn't produce any oil, and it is utterly dependent on other nations for its oil needs. Our strategic oil reserves are also too shallow to deal with any adversity that may fall on us. Unlike military capabilities, we cannot train and innovate to produce oil, but we can work on alternate sources. Our hopes are on the green energy revolution taking place around the world. It would be wonderful to switch to a green energy source sustainably. 

We depend on OPEC countries and Russia for our oil needs.

## 3. Growth through Globally Competing High-Value Finished Products

India is a resource-rich nation, but we don't have the technology to convert these resources to end products of high value that can compete in the global markets. In this regard, China has come out as our biggest trade partner, and we have an ever-growing trade deficit with them.

Raw materials, services and agriculture is our primary source of income. For India to become a superpower or at least self-reliant, we need to figure out a way to convert these essential items into products of higher value which we buy from other countries. As a nation doing well in software services, we need to migrate from being the net service provider to enabling business through these technologies.

We depend on China, the USA and many other countries to import different things and we export our services to these nations too.

## 4. Redefined Nationalism

Some countries envy India's growth and would not like it to grow further. They will increase funding to terrorists and anti-national groups, and separatists. We need to stop dividing our people in the name of religion, caste and region. We all need to be united and ignite a new fire of united India, and it has to come from top-down this time as our petty internal politics has already dealt too much damage. A state is the strongest when its people are united.


## Conclusion - Changing Geopolitcs & Arch-rival Pakistan

Now to sum it all up, the world dynamics are changing. I don't know if everyone is saying it already, but China is at par with the USA today. Russia, whose power as a communist regime was dwindling, has reignited China's growth. Together China and Russia are a very tough match for the west. Therefore our reliable ally Russia may not help us in a fight with China.

China's debt trap has caught many innocent countries, and their lands are in Chinese control, which will be a pain in the ass for the whole world.

Pakistan growing proximity with China is sad news for India. The borders with Pakistan has always been hostile, and the unresolved issue about Kashmir still irks Pakistan much. We have the resoruces, but winning a war on the two fronts is very difficult for India, and this is what China wants.

With the recent events in Ukraine and Afghanistan, the trust in the USA is at an all-time low. Nobody can be sure if the USA will come to save your ass if you are not in NATO. With Russia moving close to China, India automatically gets closer to the unreliable USA, which I think is very dangerous.

India has garnered new friends in France and Isreal who support us, but I don't know who can take the stand when the fight is with China.

Thus, if India needs to get out of this *chakravyuh*, it needs to solve the four problems as early as possible. 

Jai Hind! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
