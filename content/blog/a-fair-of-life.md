There are thing we humans have been doing for a long long time. One of them is a Fair. We all have been to some sort of fair in our lives and it might feel like a very common thing to do but imaging when humans were first evolving. How would we have been able to do that? When there were hostality amongst different tribes and different cultures. To bring all that life under under a small area where trade, commerce and fun is possible.

A fair is humans coming together on their own to an empty land to have fun. The reason we started having a fair could be for fun but I think the side-effects of them were something that we underestimate.
