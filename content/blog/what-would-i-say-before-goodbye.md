If you know today is the last time you will see people you love and it’s a bye forever. Who would you want to see and what would your last words be for them?

I'm writing this on a plane. Sometimes I get afraid of the height and the reality that this could be the last ride of my life but yet I survive and keep going. I wanted to write down these thoughts and all the people I could think of in that last day. There were not many people to list down! Also this list is in not in any order but the order in which they came to my mind.

1. Son - I would tell him that I love him the most and he is the best thing that happened in my life. I’m proud to have you as my son. 
2. Wife - I would tell her that I love her and the life would not have that nice if it was not for her. I have always found comfort in you and you have been my home. 
3. Sisters - I would tell them that they have been amazing sisters and kept up with me. I’ve not been perfect but I’ve loved them always. 
4. Father - I would tell him that he is my strength and support. I’ve tried to do things that I felt were best for me and you inspired me to be that person. Thanks for everything you have been there for me and everything you done for me. 
5. Mother - I thank you for giving me this life. I am happy to see you for one more time and the comfort it gives me. You have always believed in me and that has made me who I am. 
6. My dogs - I would pat them and kiss them and hug them and just look at their innocent eyes.

If I were to then go I would wish they all be around me happy and I leave this world happy, for one fine day every one has to go.
