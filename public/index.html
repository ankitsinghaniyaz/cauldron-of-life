    <p>I‚Äôm of the strong opinion that region, religion, language, caste, race, and like are all man-made barriers. It is a barrier that gives man a sense of false control. It makes things look limited, though in reality, it is limitless. We do not want to accept that we are no more significant than a stone or a leaf; we are just happening, and that is the purpose. These are all amplified reflections of the man‚Äôs ego. His belief in the I. The idea that I am important and things that happen to me are important. If you observe a little closer, you will realize that when you love someone, it‚Äôs because of YOU in that equation. When you feel bad about something, it is because of the I in the context. To humans, it is all about I. I don‚Äôt know if this is the case with other animals or if it is only a human phenomenon, but it must also have a purpose as it is given to us.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I have been traveling a lot since my childhood. My parents fortunately had the genes of wanderlust which I inherited. They did it in their own way by planning trips around temple. Maybe it was their way of making it worth the salt. I nonetheless enjoyed it because it was all new to me. I have a lot of memories from these trips. The long cozy train ride, the overnight cold road trips, the long queue of the temples in the heat, the first plane journey, the bluest beach of my life, the tallest waves I had ever seen or the tallest building to have ever existed. Some of them were budget trips and some luxurious. In some I was on the beach while on some I was looking at the white snow. I can go on and on about all my experiences but what is the point? I wanted to emphasize to myself that I‚Äôve travelled a good deal and seen a lot.

I wanted to write down these thoughts and all the people I could think of in that last day. There were not many people to list down! Also this list is in not in any order but the order in which they came to my mind.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Life is interestingly chaotic. We die for that which we don‚Äôt have and then get bored of that same thing when we get it. I sometimes feel that what we want is a pursuit of something. The struggle and hard work make us feel whole. In the journey, we forget everything and focus on achieving that goal.
This brings me to thinking - what do I want from life now? I have a loving family, a beautiful wife, a house to live in, a car that drives well, and now a child that won‚Äôt let me sleep(or let my wife sleep).

This creates a problem in fulfilling the dream. If we could clearly visualize what we wanted, we could undoubtedly get it. I think that‚Äôs true. Not because of some cosmic power that would bring us closer to the goal but because clarity empowers action.

What do you need to get good at building networks? Today I want to explore a set of questions sitting in the back of my head. Why do we connect with some people and not with others? What qualities make us feel that it‚Äôs worthwhile relating to someone? And more importantly, what qualities should a person possess so that other human beings desire them.

You are the piece peace of me that I‚Äôve been looking for. I‚Äôve been blessed with an almost perfect life and you just took away the almost. Maybe it was my heart that didn‚Äôt let it be perfect?
