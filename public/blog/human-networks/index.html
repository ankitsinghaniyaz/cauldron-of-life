  <div class="post-content"><p>Networking must have been essential to human evolution. It is a tool that enables us to do things that we cannot do alone. When humans were still evolving, networking was a necessity, but today it&rsquo;s a skill we must have to prosper in our community.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-need-to-get-good-at-building-networks">What do you need to get good at building networks?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-do-you-need-to-get-good-at-building-networks">#</a></h2>
<p>Today I want to explore a set of questions sitting in the back of my head. Why do we connect with some people and not with others? What qualities make us feel that it&rsquo;s worthwhile relating to someone? And more importantly, what qualities should a person possess so that other human beings desire them.</p>
<h3 id="beauty">Beauty<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#beauty">#</a></h3>
<p>He who is human shall enjoy a thing of beauty. I firmly feel that we humans are naturally attracted to what we think is beautiful. Why do we get attracted is a topic for another day. In nature, we like to collect beautiful things, and in humans, we want to be with beautiful people.</p>
<p>Beauty is one of those qualities which cannot be acquired and is a natural phenomenon. Though artificial procedures can work, I will not consider them as there are still masses who don&rsquo;t have proper medical care. Being a beauty gives us an advantage in everything we do, and I can confirm this from my experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole industry of beauty products and artificial beautification trying to make a business of this human desire.</p>
<h3 id="riches">Riches<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#riches">#</a></h3>
<p>Being rich in the 21st century is one of the easiest ways to be resourceful. There are many different kinds of people in the world. Rich but poor looking, poor but rich looking and some that are neither rich nor look affluent. Looking rich may help us be better at forming networks. If it is worth it? I&rsquo;m not sure. When you see the human urge to buy costly watches, cars, bags, houses and vacations, you can understand where these people are coming from. These things feel good in themselves(at least for some time), but they make us desirable.</p>
<h3 id="influence">Influence<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#influence">#</a></h3>
<p>If you or someone close to you happens to be in a position of power and influence, people will naturally want to be in your circle. When people find you influential, they want to be on your good book, and in turn, they would do you favours and thus add to your network.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s digital age, where everyone can have some form of influence, the ability to move people is still at the heart of it all. So many actors, politicians and activists draw their power from us, the people. Their position is relevant because people are willing to respect and honour that.</p>
<h3 id="expertise">Expertise<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#expertise">#</a></h3>
<p>People have always said that knowledge is one of the best weapons a human can wield, and it remains valid to date. Having the knowledge that others crave and building expertise gives us an edge over our peers and can open new doors.</p>
<p>Think of being the only swordsmith in your village 50,000 years ago, and everyone finds out that there&rsquo;s an attack happening. You would be the most demanded person on the planet that day. You could get anything done if you wanted.</p>
<h3 id="character">Character<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#character">#</a></h3>
<p>Character is the enigmatic component of this networking framework. It connects two people based on a mutual value system, culture and ethics. What kind of character should you have? There is no answer to that. You want to have a character that you feel true in, and that should align with the circle you want to be in. It is the salt of the well-prepared food that gives it the final taste.</p>
<p>Imagine being a kind-hearted soul aspiring to get into the mafia. I can chuckle right now.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>I suppose there are other qualities that make a person desirable, and this list shall grow with my understanding of the subject. I will love to hear from you if there&rsquo;s something that you feel makes a person resourceful and helps in networking?</p>
