  <div class="post-content"><p>Life is confusing! Isn&rsquo;t it? We envy what we don&rsquo;t have, and what we have becomes worth pebbles. I started working remotely in 2017, way before when working from home was a thing. Friends and family were almost sure that I was unemployed and probably ran some scam racket and peddled drugs. They had no other answer on how I was staying at home, chilling and still getting a decent amount of money flowing into my bank account. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now standard, and everyone has tasted remote working or work-from-home (WFH). I&rsquo;m now again titled a productive, responsible citizen of my nation, contributing to the GDP via fair means.</p>
<p>This post is not about other people but my reflection on my life. Remote work was something that I actively pursued, and when I finally had it, I did not see value in it. I&rsquo;m looking for ways to avoid this and return to the office. Believing in my head that it will be better than what I have now?</p>
<p>Remote has a lot of pros when compared to in-office work. Of course, I&rsquo;m by no means implying that it&rsquo;s perfect. I&rsquo;m not utilising the remote perks in the best possible way I should. Here are a few things I wanted for myself which made me choose remote life. Let me enlist them here to help remind myself.</p>
<h2 id="1-family-time">1. Family Time<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-family-time">#</a></h2>
<p>For many of us, returning home to our parents is not an option once we leave home for work; it is like a nestling that flees its nest and will never return. Remote has made it a possibility that was almost impossible in the past. I wanted to spend much of my time staying with my parents. Now, I also like spending time with my wife and kids. If I were an office worker, I would probably see my parents for a few days/weeks a year, and I may not be able to give my kid and wife as much time as I can now.</p>
<p>We sit in silence in the same room and continue to do our work. But the sense of the presence of family next to me makes it such a pleasant experience. I will also steal a few random kisses here and there (from my kid).</p>
<h2 id="2-pursue-hobbies">2. Pursue Hobbies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-pursue-hobbies">#</a></h2>
<p>I could improve at many things, so I like to try as many new things as possible. I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by swimming, badminton, running, shooting, book club, meeting new people, discussing technology &amp; business and many more.</p>
<p>And I knew these things would never get prioritised if I were doing an in-office job. As my weekdays will be gone in the office and over the weekend, I&rsquo;ll have to make time for family. And that idea was not something I liked.</p>
<p>Every remote work comes with a different level of flexibility. Luckily, mine is super flexible, and I can plan my day on my terms, and it&rsquo;s such an undervalued perk.</p>
<p>I could quickly sneak in an evening coffee with a friend in town. Or plan daily swim lessons at 6pm, which I would otherwise have spent in a bus or cab or driving, returning from the office.</p>
<p>Now, if I don&rsquo;t do anything about my hobbies and stay home all day. I&rsquo;m bound to feel miserable and bored. This also triggers the FOMO that office life is better.</p>
<p>I need some work here!</p>
<h2 id="3-travel-more">3. Travel More<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-travel-more">#</a></h2>
<p>If you ask me to tell you about myself, travel will be mentioned at least once in the first 5 minutes. This is one thing I genuinely enjoy; who doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>I like to see new places, soak myself in nature and enjoy life at its best with a good brewed beer in my hand. I&rsquo;m not going to add more fantasies here for my own well-being. ü•π</p>
<p>This is one thing I&rsquo;m constantly doing, and I&rsquo;m doing it right. My only suggestion here is to mix and match the kind of travel you do.</p>
<p>Travel with family, travel with spouse, travel with friends, travel solo, travel for business. Keep doing it, and have fun out of it. Don&rsquo;t let it become boring.</p>
<p>I can also choose to live in any city at any time. It&rsquo;s a superpower. ‚ö°Ô∏è</p>
<h2 id="4-save-money">4. Save Money<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-save-money">#</a></h2>
<p>If you seriously calculate the amount of money you can save, working remotely is crazy. I stay with my parents, so it&rsquo;s super crazy. Even if you don&rsquo;t stay with your parents, you can stay at a location you prefer and reduce living costs compared to a tier 1 city.</p>
<p>This saved money can, in turn, fuel your travel and other passions and hobbies.</p>
<p>It could also push in the direction of the financial independence we all look for.</p>
<h2 id="5-minimise-time-waste">5. Minimise time waste<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-minimise-time-waste">#</a></h2>
<p>I absolutely hated commuting. In my first job, I paid 50% more rent than my colleagues. I was sure about one thing: I would not like to travel and would stay as close to the office as possible.</p>
<p>Some days, I used to wonder if my boss would offer me to take a space in the office and live there. I would have accepted that offer.</p>
<p>Saving a few hours daily enables you to do much more, like making time for family, working on a hobby project, or anything else.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Given all the perks of working remotely, many people still wish to be able to work remotely. A noble percentage feel remote is not for them, and I do not doubt their judgment.</p>
<p>In my company, we ask a question every Friday: &ldquo;Do you feel remote working has more positive or negative aspects?&rdquo; My answer is always more positive.</p>
<p>Till I continue to answer the same, remote work is for me, and I need to stay on top of it to ensure that I am making the best of it.</p>
<p>We meet our teammates during workations and team outings, and it&rsquo;s a fresh, rejuvenating experience I look forward to, but will I give up these superpowers for anything else? Heck no!</p>
