I wanted to emphasize to myself that I’ve travelled a good deal and seen a lot.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/img/camp3.png" alt="Group of people living in a community who know the purpose of life"  />
</p>
<p>My preferences for traveling has evolved over the years. I’ve traveled with family, solo, with a friend and with a group of friends. Now I also travel with my own kid. From being a kid to taking a kid on travel I have come a long way.  Today I’m not much fascinated by places to be honest. All that I need to make me happy is a good weather, nice view, some breeze and light and some greenary. This is my happy place. Though when I think about this further these are all secondary. The first thing that I need is a Tribe.</p>
<p>Tribe is anyone who makes me feel alive, makes me a better person. I hope we have a few people that make us feel like that.</p>
<p>Okay so we know that I need my tribe and the nature to feel good. So how about we plan a little, about the kind of vacation I would want to have?</p>
<p>My vacations are more like long term, where a few families come and live together. We have evenings together where we cook and share dinner. In winter we light up fire and sit beside it and enjoy. Some days the whole tribe sit around the fire, some days it’s only the guys and on some it’s only the family. A place where kids and adults have free space and time to play. There’s cricket going on, kids are running and shouting and getting all dirty.  On days there is football and all age group plays together. There’s group hiking and picnics by the river, where some enjoy a small pint of beer with a small light lit ☘️. Take a dip in the slow flowing river.</p>
<p>Or if I happen to be on a mountain, I wait for the first snow to fall and you go out with your snow gears and play. While I wait for the snow I would enjoy the heavenly combination of sun and cold breeze of a mountain. I don’t even know how to play in snow but I can learn. This just sounds so amazing right.</p>
<p>There will also be hard work, where we do something with our hands to meet our needs. Growing a little of our own crops and also doing something professionally. Knowledge session for kids. I know this sounds like a big privilege and it indeed is, but it may not be that elusive as it may seem to some of us who are used to the daily grind. I’m the one used to the daily grind.</p>
<p>What questions I still have not figured out and probably many might have not figured out too is how do you make it possible? Is it all only possible because I can work digitally? Does it become impossible if I stop that? Also if I do this would it spoil my kid’s future chances? Would they come and tell me that I messed up their growth be not being in a better city? How much effort would there be to do this? How difficult would it be to find like minded people? Would there be politics eventually? What will I do if I stop liking it myself?</p>
<p>These are all hard questions and so is anything worth having. I’m going to work through these questions and keep making progress and keep writing about how successfully I’ve been failing and how I continue to take my chances. Adios!</p>
